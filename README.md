I'm currently pursuing my M.Tech in Information Security at Somaiya Vidyavihar University, with a strong focus on Cloud Security. I’m working towards building secure and scalable environments across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

My areas of interest include:

Identity & Access Management (IAM) & Zero Trust

Threat Detection & SIEM

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

API & Application Security

Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Cloud Security

Compliance & Risk Management

I’ve been exploring tools like AWS GuardDuty, Azure Sentinel, Terraform, Splunk, Burp Suite, and more — applying them in hands-on projects and labs. I’m also learning to secure APIs, implement Zero Trust frameworks, and harden infrastructure using best practices.

This GitHub is where I’ll document my learning journey, projects, and cloud security experiments. Open to collaborations, feedback, and networking with fellow security learners and professionals.

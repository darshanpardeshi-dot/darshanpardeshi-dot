Cloud Security Enthusiast currently pursuing an M.Tech in Information Security at Somaiya Vidyavihar University. I’m passionate about securing cloud environments across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with a focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM), Threat Detection, Risk Management, and Compliance.

Hands-on with tools like AWS GuardDuty, Azure Sentinel, Terraform, Splunk, and Burp Suite. I’m also learning to implement Zero Trust frameworks, secure APIs, and build secure infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code best practices.

Always exploring, always learning — open to collaborations, internships, and opportunities in the Cloud Security space. Let’s connect.
